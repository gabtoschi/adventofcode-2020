# Advent of Code 2020
These are my codes and answers to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020),an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

My goal this year is to learn Python, so I'm coding all the puzzles' solutions in Python 3. Don't expect really good and/or optimized algorithms: AoC for me is just a way to learn and practice a new programming language and have fun. Also, I cannot resist a puzzle hunt, hahaha!

BUT, if you are searching for really cool and well done Python resolutions for the puzzles, check out [Ç´abriel Kanegae's AoC 2020 repository](https://github.com/KanegaeGabriel/advent-of-code-2020). He is a great programmer, a really special friend and my inspiration to code this holiday in AoC. He also solved all the previous puzzles; all of them are linked in the 2020 page.

So, good luck getting stars, Merry Christmas and a Happy (Oh, God, please, be happy) New Year!
